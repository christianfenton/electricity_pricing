# Electricity Price Forecasting

The aim of this project is to explore methods of forecasting electricity prices in Great Britain (GB) on the day-ahead power markets.

Day-ahead electricity prices in Great Britain are determined through auctions where buyers and sellers agree on prices for specific delivery periods. Most short-term energy trades in GB occur for hourly and half-hourly settlement periods on day-ahead auctions.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies using Poetry by running

```bash
cd electricity_pricing
poetry install
```

## Overview

- `data/processed/`: Contains CSV files with data on electricity prices, weather, and some other key variables.
- `notebooks/exploratory_analysis.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis identifying trends, seasonal patterns, and correlations between electricity prices, weather variables, and generation sources.

## Data Sourcing and Processing

Processed weather and electricity price data is already available in this repository's `data/processed/` directory. Users that want to  process raw data themselves can download the relevant raw weather and gas price data from the Met Office and Office for National Statistics websites by following the links below, update the paths in `create_datasets.py` accordingly, and run
```bash
python create_datasets.py
```

### Weather data locations

- Heathrow, Greater London: Close to major population centre and wind farms in the Thames Estuary
- Crosby, Merseyside: Close to major population centre and wind farms in the Irish Sea
- Dyce, Aberdeenshire: Close to major population centre and wind farms in the North Sea

### Units

- Power: megawatts (MW)
- Electricity and natural gas prices: GBP per megawatt hour (Â£ / MWh)
- Wind speed: metres per second (m/s)
- Wind direction: degrees
- Temperature: degrees Celsius
- Solar irradiation: kilojoules per metre squared (KJ/m^2)

### Glossary of terms

- AGPT: Actual generation data per settlement period aggregrated by power system resource type
- FUELHH: Half-hourly generation outturn aggregrated by fuel type
- CCGT: Combined cycle gas turbine
- OCGT: Open cycle gas turbine
- NPSHYD: Non-pumped storage hydropower
- PS: Pumped storage
- INTER:  Imports/exports from/to other grids via interconnectors
- INDO: Initial national demand outturn.
- ITSDO: Initial transmission system demand outturn.

The AGPT data does not include flows from interconnects, while the FUELHH data does not include energy generation from solar or embedded generation. The AGPT and FUELHH data are merged to get an accurate breakdown of the different energy generation sources.
