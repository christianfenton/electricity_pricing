# Electricity Price Forecasting

The aim of this project is to explore methods of forecasting electricity prices in Great Britain (GB) on the day-ahead power markets.

Day-ahead electricity prices in Great Britain are determined through auctions where buyers and sellers agree on prices for specific delivery periods. Most short-term energy trades in GB occur for hourly and half-hourly settlement periods on day-ahead auctions.
