# Electricity Price Forecasting

The aim of this project is to explore methods of forecasting electricity prices in Great Britain (GB) on the day-ahead power markets.

Day-ahead electricity prices in Great Britain are determined through auctions where buyers and sellers agree on prices for specific delivery periods. Most short-term energy trades in GB occur for hourly and half-hourly settlement periods on day-ahead auctions.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies using Poetry by running

```bash
cd electricity_pricing
poetry install
```

## Overview

- `data/processed/`: Contains CSV files with data on electricity prices, weather, and some other key variables.
- `notebooks/exploratory_analysis.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis investigating trends, seasonal patterns, and correlations between electricity prices, weather variables, and generation sources.

## Data

Processed weather and electricity price data is already available in this repository's `data/processed/` directory.

Users that want to process raw data themselves can download the relevant datasets, update the paths in `create_datasets.py` accordingly, and run
```bash
python create_datasets.py
```

### Data Sources

Actual historical data and forecasted data on electricity price, demand and generation are sourced from the [Elexon BMRS API](https://bmrs.elexon.co.uk) and the [National Energy System Operator's data portal](https://www.neso.energy/data-portal).

Natural gas prices are sourced from the [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/datasets/systemaveragepricesapofgas).

Weather data is sourced from the UK Met Office (see references below). The locations used were Heathrow in Greater London, Crosby in Merseyside and Dyce in Aberdeenshire, since these are all near major population centres and wind farms.

### Glossary of terms

- MIP: Market index price of electricity
- AGPT: Actual generation data per settlement period aggregrated by power system resource type
- FUELHH: Half-hourly generation outturn aggregrated by fuel type
- CCGT: Combined cycle gas turbine
- OCGT: Open cycle gas turbine
- NPSHYD: Non-pumped storage hydropower
- PS: Pumped storage
- INTER:  Imports/exports from/to other grids via interconnectors
- INDO: Initial national demand outturn
- ITSDO: Initial transmission system demand outturn

The AGPT data does not include flows from interconnects, while the FUELHH data does not include energy generation from solar or embedded generation. The AGPT and FUELHH data are merged to get an accurate breakdown of the different energy generation sources.
